Problem Statement:
The Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center's report reveals that just 24% of India's adult population is financially literate, the lowest among major emerging economies. This deficiency is due to limited awareness and a lack of formal financial education, both in schools and at home. Finsmart seeks to address this issue by offering a platform dedicated to financial literacy education using artificialÂ intelligence.
